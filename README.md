# GoSee

A lightweight, live markdown previewer to be used in the browser.

For people who use vim or another terminal based editor who want to see their markdown without the use of a previewer from VSCode or other editors.

### Usage

`gosee <file>`

GoSee will watch a markdown file for changes and send updates to the browser used for viewing. Static assets can be placed in a `static` directory, which will be served by GoSee.

### Goals:
- Github-flavored markdown styling
- Support for more filetypes (tex?)
